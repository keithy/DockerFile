LoadModule realdoc_module /usr/lib/apache2/mod_realdoc.so

# Rasmus module for php, enables live switching of DocumentRoot trees html->A html->B
# DocumentRoot is resolved to a real path at the beginning of a user session
# and remains set for the remainder of the session, even if the actual DocumentRoot
# is a symlink which has been moved elsewhere mid session.
# This enables the user to complete their session within the same codebase.
# Code referencing the filesystem needs to be written such that paths are not hard coded,
# but are always relative to DocumentRoot.
